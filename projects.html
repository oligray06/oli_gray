            <h2 style="font-weight: 600;">Java Game 2021</h2>
            <p>This is a game that i have made as part of my programming in java university coursework.
                In the game you play as a spaceship pilot that has to travel through asteroid fields before facing
                three boss ships.
            </p>    
            <p>The player is able to shoot lasers by pressing the space key and move by using either the arrow keys or A/D.
                Sometimes, when the asteroids are shot by a players laser, they will drop a heart that restores 1 HP or a power up
                that lets the player fire special lasers for 5 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, by pressing the B key, the player can execute a special move that fires 7 lasers at the same time
                which is effective at clearing lots of asteroids.
            </p>
            <p>The game has a GUI menu that is able to restart, pause and resume, skip levels, save and load and quit the game.
                The saving feature allows the player to save a state of the game within any of the levels and load it back whenever
                the choose to by clicking the load button. the saved state contains information from the time of saving so if the player
                was halfway through a level, that is where they will be restored to.
            </p>

            <p> Below is an edited video demonstrating the games features.

            <p>This site was created by me to make it easier for me to add up my shifts worked at my job. Using this
                site made it much easier than adding my hours up on paper and then multiplying by specific amounts
                dependant
                on the day. It is currently used by colleagues that find it useful and is also still used by myself.</p>

            <p>This is my first university programming project, concluding the 2-week programming bootcamp. This
                project, written in Processing demonstrates my understanding of the use of arrays, loops and classes. I
                have created a digital piano that can be used by the mouse cursor or the keys on the keyboard. The
                keyboard is ‘built’ by using objects from a class. This means that all the keys you see are from the
                same code. Their positioning is done mathematically instead of manually.</p>
